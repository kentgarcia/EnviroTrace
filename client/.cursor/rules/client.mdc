# Cursor Rules for eco-dash-navigator Client

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Main source code for the frontend (React/TypeScript).
- `src-tauri/`: Tauri backend and configuration.
- `public/`: Static assets served directly.
- `build-resources/`, `cert/`, `dist/`: Build outputs, certificates, and distribution files.
- Do not place source code outside `src/` or `src-tauri/`.

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code in `src/`.
- Prefer functional React components and hooks.
- Use named exports unless a file has a single main export.
- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- Use components in `@presentation/components/shared/` if necessary.

## Naming Conventions
- Filenames: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for React components.
- Variables: camelCase.
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase, prefix interfaces with `I` only if necessary.

## Dependencies
- Add new dependencies with `cd client` and `npm install`.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; prefer built-in or standard libraries.

## Testing
- Place tests in `src/__tests__/`.
- Use Jest for unit tests.
- All new features should include relevant tests.
