# Sapling Replacement Recommendation System

## Overview

A frontend-only recommendation system that analyzes tree cutting requests and provides intelligent sapling replacement suggestions based on historical planting data and local success rates.

## Features Implemented

### 🌳 **Automatic Replacement Ratio Calculation**

- **Base ratio**: 1 sapling per tree cut
- **Enhanced ratios**:
  - Large/mature trees: 2-3x replacement
  - Emergency cuts: Reduced ratio for safety situations
- **Smart parsing**: Extracts quantities from tree descriptions

### 📊 **Species Recommendations Based on Local Success Rates**

- Analyzes historical planting records in the same area
- Calculates success rates by species (planted → growing/mature vs died/removed)
- Prioritizes species with proven track records locally
- Shows average survival rates for each recommended species

### 🎯 **Success Rate Analysis**

- **Historical performance**: Based on actual planting outcomes
- **Location-based**: Prioritizes species that thrive in similar areas
- **Data-driven insights**: Uses survival rates and status tracking
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded success rates and badges

### 💰 **Cost Estimation & Planning**

- Estimated cost per sapling by species type
- Total replacement cost calculations
- Budget planning assistance
- Resource optimization suggestions

### ⏰ **Urgency & Compliance Tracking**

- **Priority levels**: High/Medium/Low based on cutting date
- **Deadline monitoring**: Tracks time since tree cutting
- **Compliance status**: Visual indicators for replacement progress
- **Alert system**: Highlights overdue replacements

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Analysis**

```typescript
// Analyzes existing tree cutting requests
const cuttingRequests = treeCuttingRequests.filter(
  (req) => req.request_type === "cutting"
);

// Calculates species success rates from planting records
const speciesAnalysis = {
  Mahogany: { total: 35, successful: 30, avgSurvivalRate: 85.7 },
  Narra: { total: 8, successful: 8, avgSurvivalRate: 92.0 },
  // ...
};
```

### 2. **Smart Recommendations**

```typescript
// Generates recommendations based on:
- Historical success rates in the area
- Species performance data
- Replacement ratios
- Cost considerations
- Seasonal planting guidelines
```

### 3. **Visual Dashboard**

- Interactive species selection cards
- Success rate badges and progress bars
- Cost and timeline estimates
- Priority alerts and compliance tracking

## Usage

### In Tree Management Page

1. Navigate to **Tree Management**
2. Click **"Sapling Recommendations"** tab
3. View automated recommendations for all cutting requests
4. Select preferred species for each request

### Standalone Demo

- Visit `/urban-greening/sapling-recommendations-demo`
- Includes sample data showcasing all features
- Interactive demonstration of the recommendation engine

## Key Benefits

### ✅ **Compliance Automation**

- Every tree cutting automatically generates replacement requirements
- Visual tracking of completion status
- Deadline alerts prevent oversight

### 📈 **Data-Driven Decisions**

- Recommendations based on actual performance data
- Location-specific success rates
- Historical trend analysis

### 🎯 **Optimized Resource Use**

- Cost-effective species selection
- Seasonal planting guidance
- Maintenance level considerations

### 🚀 **Frontend-Only Implementation**

- No backend changes required
- Works with existing data
- Real-time analysis and recommendations

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- `SaplingRecommendationEngine.tsx` - Main recommendation component
- `TreeManagement.tsx` - Integrated with existing tree management
- `SaplingRecommendationDemo.tsx` - Standalone demonstration

### Data Sources

- **Tree Cutting Requests**: `TreeManagementRequest[]`
- **Planting Records**: `UrbanGreeningPlanting[]`
- **Success Analysis**: Calculated from planting status tracking

### Key Algorithms

1. **Replacement Ratio Calculation**: Based on tree size, species, cutting reason
2. **Success Rate Analysis**: Status tracking (planted → growing/mature vs died)
3. **Species Prioritization**: Local performance + proximity matching
4. **Cost Estimation**: Species-specific pricing with quantity calculations

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with monitoring requests for replacement tracking
- Machine learning for improved success rate predictions
- Weather and soil condition factors
- Mobile app support for field teams
- Automated compliance reporting
